# NBA Strength of Schedule
 
While every NBA team plays 82 games and each team at least once at home and at least once away, not every NBA schedule is created equally. This project plans to look into what schedule related factors influence winning and then hopes to build a strength of schedule ranking.

### Data
**NBA GAME SCHEDULES**  
Using [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), the NBA schedule was scraped giving the teams playing, the location of the game and the date.

**ESPN RPM Numbers**  
End of season [ESPN RPM Numbers](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm) were scraped and will be used to account for the players who actually played in the game (injuries, rest, etc.).
